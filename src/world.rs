//! A scene is composed of many shapes.
//! This module implements a list of shapes: the `World` type.
//!
//! - It maintains a list of `Shape` objects.
//! - It implements a `ray_intersection` method that iterates over the shapes,
//! searches for intersections, and returns the one closest to the ray origin.
